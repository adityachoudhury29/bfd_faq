Following assumptions were made while creating this project:

1. Every single FAQ is available on each and every one of the supported languages.
2. Supported languages for the API can be updated as per admin's requirements, directly in the codebase(faq_app/supported_languages.py).

Note:
All the code in this codebase follows pep8 conventions, except E501(line too long).
E501 is being caused mainly due to long comments describing the code.
However, the presence of comments is important for clarity.
Hence E501 has been ignored. Rest all conventions have been followed and taken care of.
