Following assumptions were made while creating the project:

1. Every single FAQ is available on each and every one of the supported languages.
2. Supported languages for the API can be updated as per admin's requirements, directly in the codebase(faq_app/supported_languages.py).
3. Redis port has been forwarded to :6380 unlike the conventional :6379 while using docker.
